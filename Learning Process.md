This process helps identify gaps in understanding and reinforces learning through active recall and explanation.

## what is most interesting idea?
 "Learning How to Learn" is the concept of two modes of thinking: 
 focused and diffuse Focused mode is for deep concentration and solving specific problems, while diffuse mode is for relaxed, 
 big-picture thinking and connecting ideas.Effective learning happens by switching between these modes, which helps in mastering 
 complex subjects.

## What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
Active mode of thinking involves focused, concentrated effort on a specific task or concept, 
often leading to deep understanding and retention of information. Diffused mode of thinking, on the other hand, 
occurs when the mind is in a relaxed, wandering state, allowing for connections between ideas and creative problem-solving.
