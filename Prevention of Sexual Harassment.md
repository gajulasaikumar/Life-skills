2. Prying into personal matters by asking intrusive questions about their sexual life or preferences.
3. Encroaching on personal space by standing excessively close, brushing against them, or obstructing their movement.
4. Sending unsolicited sexually explicit messages via email, text, or social media platforms.
5. Engaging in any form of inappropriate physical contact, such as touching, groping, hugging, or kissing, without consent.

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

1. Clearly convey to the harasser that their conduct is unwelcome and must cease.
2. Confide in a trusted individual about what transpired, whether it's a friend, family member, or colleague.
