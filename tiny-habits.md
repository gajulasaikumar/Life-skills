## Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

This triggers the release of dopamine in our brain, making us feel good and strengthening the connection to the new habit. Over time, this positive reinforcement helps the habit become automatic.

## In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for me?

In James Clear's "1% Better Every Day" video, the most interesting idea is focusing on making small, daily improvements. By getting just 1% better each day, these small changes add up to significant progress over time. This approach is practical and motivating, making it easier to maintain good habits and achieve long-term success.

## What is the book's perspective about Identity?

In James Clear's "Atomic Habits," the idea is that lasting habits come from changing your identity. Focus on who you want to be, not just on what you want to achieve. For example, instead of saying "I want to run a marathon," say "I am a runner." This shift helps you adopt behaviors that match your new identity and reinforces the habits needed to become that person.
